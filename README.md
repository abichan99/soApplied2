# 소응 앉아가자 프로젝트 프론트엔드 초기 코드(미완성)

사용자가 입력한 호선, 방향(~방면), 승차역, 하차역을 기반으로 앉아갈 확률이 높은 칸 추천

## 만든 기능

1. 사용자 선택지 입력란
    - 선택지 리스트를 제공함으로서 사용자의 입력 미스 방지 및 세큐리티 리스크 경감 
    - 선택된 선택지를 바탕으로 다른 선택란의 적젏한 선택지를 동적제공

## 만들 기능

1. 입력치 검증 및 추천 칸 제공하는 서버에 입력치 제공
2. 제공받은 추천 칸 정보를 바탕으로 사용자에게 추천 칸 표시

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
